# 1.	ABSTRACT
“We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields”-Alan Turing.
Initially what had started with designing calculators to help mathematicians, computers have superseded its initial goal to seep into every aspect of human life. Today, computers have made life much simpler with every facility available at beck and call simply by the push of a button. Be it booking flights, restaurants or movies, or be it ordering readymade food or purchasing clothes, everything can be done from the comfort of home, just by making a few clicks in the smartphone or the laptop. This project also, encompasses one such aspect of online shopping that has led to the surge of e-commerce websites that allows customers to shop a litany of items right from groceries, to apparel, to items of daily use.
This document covers the problem statement, the project plan, the motivation and the challenges, and throws light on the design perspective of the project, and takes a module-wise coverage of the entire project and its implementation. 

# 2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT		
It is a genuine pleasure to express our deep sense of gratitude to our project guide and mentor Professor Karan Singh. His keen interest, support, enthusiasm and above all his overwhelming attitude to guide his students has been solely and mainly responsible for completing our work. His timely advice, meticulous scrutiny, valuable guidance and scientific approach has ushered and inspired us to a great extent to successfully accomplish this project.
		We are also indebted to him for imbibing in us a sense of responsibility and team spirit by assigning us teams and for encouraging us to work together towards a common goal. This project has given us a better insight about the subject and the implementation has given us a golden opportunity to apply what we have learnt in the class and we shall forever be grateful for the same.

# 3. INTRODUCTION
## 3.1 IMPLICAITON OF NAME
Panache is an epithet describing “something that people find attractive”. Since this website is all about attractive and unique gift items, this term is deemed to be the most befitting.
## 3.2 BACKGROUND
The custom of gifting has been all-pervading and ubiquitous, and so is the art of selecting appropriate and distinctive gifts with a touch of nuance and endearment. History is replete with traditions of gifting which is vindicated by both literature and mythology. Be it the gifts heralded by the Magi or the infamous Trojan horse, the art of gifting surpasses vanity and flamboyance, seeping its roots into the fertile soil of amity and an avant-garde selection. To reduce the omnipresent dilemma of what to gift to loved ones, we as a team seek to offer a plausible solution- “Panache” – a customized website devised to finally resolve this quandary by providing a wide range of unique and personalized gifting items. The vogue of gifting has somehow restricted itself to the clichéd chocolates or cakes, perfumes or watches that portray a lack of forethought and creativity. “Panache” aims to resolve this predicament by its off-the-beat suggestions to meet every budget, ranging from shoestring to extravagant.
## 3.3 OBJECTIVES
Panache aims to take a tour of the domain of providing exclusive and customized gift items based on relations, age, preferences and budget. The project aims to design an e-commerce site wherein a user can search for a range of items based on an intricate search mechanism.

## 3.4 MOTIVATION
The source of motivation of “Panache” is Bewakoof.com and we are indebted to them for the same. Bewakoof.com is a website/app that delivers customized items to its customers. What sets this beautiful website apart from its other competitors is its novel idea of printing catchy taglines on mundane items like t-shirts, cushions, pillow covers, clocks, etc. in order to bring life to the ordinary objects. This idea was an instant hit amidst the youngsters resulting in a spike in sales despite having so many competitors. 
Launched on April 1, 2012, by IITians Prabhkiran Singh and Siddharth Munot, Bewakoof.com has relied on quirky, funny, out-of-the-box messaging on its products to connect with its customers. Its story is nothing short of motivation. The duo had decided to step foot in the e-commerce industry at a time when the market was full of cut-throat competition – new websites like Snapdeal, Ajio, Myntra and several others were growing and there was a very stiff competition. Besides, the duo had a very stringent budget and could not afford to take a usurious risk. This is where their novelty set foot, and they came up with the idea of providing customised gift items, making their idea an instant hit. Even today, Bewakoof.com has a very steadfast customer base due to its high quality fabric, unique catch phrases, quality regulation, prompt service and innovative ideas.
Setting a niche for yourselves in an already populated area is never easy, even worse when worked with a shoestring budget. Being students looking for some extra income and work experience, Singh and Munot wanted to start their own ecommerce site with very little investment. Thus, their stories stand out as those of sheer inspiration and innovation.

## 3.5 CHALLENGE
From a competitive standpoint, the foremost challenge was to devise a unique idea in order to thrive the market competition. Thus, a realm of providing gift solutions was introduced that not only has less competition but will also have economic viability. 
Other challenges included the inclusion of all the features pertaining to a standard e-commerce website, besides providing customization options to the customers.

## 3.6 PROJECT AIM
The aim of this project is to design a fully functional e-commerce site that ends the ubiquitous dilemma of providing thoughtful gifts to your loved ones while maintaining a budget. Panache offers an easy and approachable solution as it is catered specifically to providing unique gift ideas for all ages, genders and budget. It also includes a range of personalized items (like tees, clocks, pillows, etc.) where you can provide your own messages or insider jokes and make your loved ones feel special.

# 4. BACKGROUND
## 4.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT
“Panache” is an e-commerce website to provide gifting solutions to its customers based on their relations, budget and preference, besides providing all the functionalities of a basic e-commerce website. The customer must be able to browse through a variety of items, search the items by name and should be able to add items to cart before checkout. The items should be dynamically updated from time to time by the admin. The customer should be able to fill a form to view a list of potential gift items that can be gifted by them. The following sections gives an in-depth explanation of the features to be included.
## 4.2 FEATURES
The objective of the project is to build a successful website that caters to all standards of a “good” website. Though the term “good” sounds obscure and ambiguous, a standard e-commerce site should have the following components- 
1) Providing an interactive interface
2) Supporting multiple users
3) Viewing and searching items
4) Create a cart for shortlisting items
5) Proceed to checkout 
6) Provide a robust and secure payment gateway and generate the receipt. 
7) Provide an admin panel to monitor items, add new items, impose new search constraints and view orders and payment details. 
8) Allow the customer to update address, phone number, password, etc.
## 4.3 ADVANCED FEATURES
The advanced features, were listed down at the time of analysis, and were not confirmed to be delivered due to the technical intricacies involved. However, they have been implemented after a detailed study about the technologies:
	GUEST MODE: Allows user to add products to cart even in the guest mode. A guest is a user who has not logged in, that is, a user who does not have an account registered to the website. However, in order to purchase an item, the user needs to create an account.
	GIFT SUGGESTIONS: The system provides suggestions to users based on their budget and the details of the person to be gifted. For example, in order to gift an item to your brother, items like wallets and grooming kits will be displayed, whereas, to gift a suitable item to your sister, items like purses and make-up kits will be displayed. Relevant items are displayed for a variety of relations such as partners, siblings, couples, bosses, etc.
	VIEW PREVIOUS ORDERS: Allows the customer to view his previous purchases. This requires the generation of payment receipt for each item and to store the item details with timestamp for every individual user.
	SEARCH: Allows the user to search items on the basis of the item name or item type. For example, if the user enters “clock”, all the clocks and watches available are to be displayed. This was tricky since the keywords entered manually are supposed to be searched efficiently.

## 4.4 ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
These characteristics include the features that are crucial to the viability of the system. These are not mere facilities that enhance the working of the system, but are crucial to the very existence of the project, forming its backbone.
	MUTUAL EXCLUSION – The cart should be mutually exclusive and private to the user. Even if multiple users are using the same machine but different accounts, they should not be able to view the carts of other users. Modification in one cart should have no impact on the carts of any other user.
	SECURITY: This is a mandatory characteristic of utmost importance. The breach of security in a website involving payment shall lead to catastrophic consequences. Thus, security is the most crucial responsibility that comes along with online payment. As a solution to this problem, the secure PayPal integration has been used after proper Sand Box testing.
	UNDERSTANABILITY: The target audience for this website is the general public who may or may not have a tech-savvy taste. They might be unfamiliar with technologies and may not be conversant to using e-commerce websites. Thus, the front-end should be designed in a user-friendly manner so that even a naïve user can operate it with great ease.

## 4.5 TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVED
The major technologies used were:
	HTML
	CSS
	 JAVASCRIPT 
	PHP 
	SQL
	AJAX
	Bootstrap (minimal usage)
4.6 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
The hardware requirements are as follows:
	A laptop or PC
	An active internet connection 
	RAM 500Mb or higher
	Windows Operating System

## 4.7 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The software requirements are as follows:
	Any version of Chrome 10 or higher
	XAMPP server
	MySQL database
	Standard editor such as Notepad++

# 5. SYSTEM ANALYSIS
This portion covers the aspects that led to the selection of this topic and also throws light on the various websites available for this purpose and how our project tries to overcome the drawbacks of most of the software that are available in the market. Also, it provides a feasibility study that had been conducted carefully to ensure that the project was feasible to conduct and complete.
## 5.1 IDENTIFICATION OF NEED
Despite the abundance of e-commerce sites in the market, there is not one website that caters specifically to providing smart gifting solutions. Though there are a lot of fashion related websites, you have to put in your idea of gifting such as purses, flowers, etc. which ultimately equates it down to you pondering for the gift ideas. Thus, we thought of hammering this nail by providing a website that actually selects a gift for your loved ones without much thought from your side.
## 5.2 PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION
Firstly, the relevance of the project was gauged by estimating the level of competition it might encounter in real-time market. Once this risk was eliminated, and the topic was finalized, the next step was to select the best technology to develop the website. Though there are several software technologies in the market that make web-designing a less cumbersome project, they do not allow the designers to unleash their full potential. For example, Bootstrap allows us to embed ready-made code into our own application thereby limiting the designer’s efforts. 
Since this project was made for the purpose of learning how to design and implement a website from the scratch, the most common and primitive technologies have been used to enable designing right from the scratch. This includes Notepad++ and Chrome browser for editing and viewing respectively, and MySQL database for designing tables and adding and retrieving data. 
## 5.3 FEASIBILITY STUDY
An extensive feasibility study is carried out to determine the viability of the idea ensuring that the project is legally and technically feasible as well as economically justifiable. The purpose of the feasibility study is to determine whether a project is worth an investment. The five areas of project feasibility are mentioned below:
1) Technical feasibility-Technical feasibility study is the complete study of the project in terms of input, processes, output, fields, programs and procedures. It was found that the hardware specifications and the software required were easily available and are openly available and are hence feasible to use.
2) Economic feasibility- As only open source and primitive technologies were used, this project is hence economically feasible to implement.
3) Legal feasibility- Legal feasibility determines whether the proposed system conflicts any legal requirements. The project does not involve any controversial issues, neither does it hurt any cultural or ethical issues and is hence considered to be legally feasible.
4) Operational feasibility-Operational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems. The main objective of the project is to provide gifting ideas based on customizations, hence it was noted that on completion, the project would be able to satisfy the requirements (as listed in requirement specification) and is hence deemed to be operationally feasible.
5) Scheduling feasibility- An extensive planning was carried out to ensure that the project would meet the deadlines. The various sub-tasks were identified and the work was distributed accordingly to ensure that all the deadlines are met and the targets are fulfilled. Though there were unprecedented obstacles leading to delays, we were able to overcome the hardships.
## 5.4 MODULES OF THE PROJECT
The 12 modules derived at the analysis phase are diagrammatically represented below.
 
# 6 PROJECT SCHEDULING AND PLANNING
## 6.1 PROJECT DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES
There exists several standard methodologies to accomplish a project successfully. Such methodologies specify the procedures right from the scratch till the very end of the project. This standardizes the method and provides a systematic approach to plan, design, implement and maintain large projects. The methods may be sequential, such as the Waterfall model or cyclic such as the Spiral model. These methodologies are chosen on the basis of the importance of the project, the criticality and risk involved, and the number of members required.
## 6.2 CHOSEN METHODOLOGY
The Waterfall method was adopted for the development of the project due to the following factors:
1)	Simplicity of the waterfall model
2)	Number of team members are less hence less focus is to be given on coordination
3)	Low risk involved, as per the risk analysis conducted (shown above)
4)	Requirements known already hence Waterfall model is the most suitable.

The various stages involved in the project development were:
1. Requirements analysis and definition: The entire project idea was analyzed and was checked for feasibility. The expectations or goals from the project were listed, and the problem statement was formally defined and tasks were identified.
2. System and software design: The modules were designed and the tasks were distributed. The constraints and limitations were discussed and diagrams, DFDs and charts were drawn to comprehend the problem. Data requirements were identified and tables were created and normalized.
3. Implementation: During this stage, the design was realized as a set of PHP scripts. However, the pages were isolated and were yet to be integrated as a unit.
4. Integration and system testing: The individual program units were integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met. 

 ## 6.3 GANTT CHART
The various activities were identified and then a rough scheduling was done on the estimate time for each task on the basis of the table given below:

        Figure 6.2: Gantt chart showing the estimated time plan 	
However due to unprecedented changes in the situation, there was slight discrepancy in the schedule due to which there was some deviation from the above plan.
The tasks mentioned above are described as follows:

13)	CUSTOMISATIONS: Provides customizations based on age, budget and relationships and suggests relevant items for the client.

## 7.2 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
The functional requirements for a system describe what the expectations from the end-product are. It categorically lists such requirements that directly affect the outcome or the quality of the project.
The functional requirements of the project were as follows:

1	MUTUAL EXCLUSTION	The cart, customer details and the orders must be visible only to the respective users. Other users/non-users shouldn’t be able to access details that are not their own.
2	INTERACTIVE INTERFACE	The interface should be friendly enough to be used by any non-technical user.
3	SECURITY	Security should be of utmost importance as the payment details of the customer should be completely confidential and secure.
4	SEARCH AND FILTER	The user should be able to search items by their names and brands and must be able to sort them.
5	CUSTOMISATION	The website should be capable of providing gift ideas based on user requirements and budget.
6	MONITORING	There should be an admin who shall be capable of controlling the entire website.

Table 7.1: Functional Requirements

## 7.3 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Non-functional requirements, as the name suggests, are requirements that are not directly connected to the end product delivered, but impact the quality of the project to be developed. This includes non-essential features that enhance the operability and quality of the software, such as, how much load it can take, how less is the response time, how does it respond to anomalous situation, etc. Some of the non-functional requirements are listed below:
ID	PROPERTY	         DESCRIPTION
1	Correctness	This quantifies if all the objectives are met and the system responds correctly to the input.
2	Robustness	This quantifies how well can the system adopt to sudden and unexpected conditions not encountered before.
3	Reliability	This quantifies if the system is reliable and can produce the expected outcome every time it is executed.
4	Portability	This quantifies if the system is adaptive enough to run in different environments by slight modifications.
5	Maintainability	This quantifies if the system can meet up to the changing expectations over time and can be modified and maintained.
6	Tailorability	This quantifies to what extent can new modifications be included and how fast can they be incorporated and used.

Table 7.2: Non-functional requirements
These requirements, both functional and non-functional were listed at the beginning of the project by intuition and analysis of the proposed system. All these requirements were met by the final project to the best of our knowledge.
# 8. SYSTEM DESIGN
This chapter describes the design process utilized for the completion of this e-commerce website. In order to highlight the theory applied, the chapter is supported by various conceptual diagrams. Architectural design of this project has been illustrated at various abstraction levels through this chapter.
The software design phase is an iterative process that is applied after analyzing the specified requirements in order to translate requirements specification into a structured plan for software construction. Suggested guidelines and technical criteria are followed throughout the design process in order to achieve a high quality end product.
## 8.1 DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND CONSTRAINTS
Design principles guide a software engineer to construct high quality system design. Following principles have been applied during design phase of this project:
	The design should be easily altered in order to respond to changes.
	Integrity and uniformity is crucial in good design.
	Design should be in higher abstraction level that coding logic.
Some of the essential features of a good design are as follows:
1)	Modularity – Modularity enables breaking the problem into distinct sub-parts such that each sub-part can be developed independently oblivious to the other modules present. These modules are later integrated into the final product.
2)	 Information Hiding - Information within each module should be public only for modules that actually need that information. For example, a user might use different accounts from one machine. Each account should be able to hide its information from the other accounts. Information hiding concept is useful when it comes to later amendments needed in the project. Thus errors occurred in one module will not affect others.
3)	Abstraction – Abstraction means to hide background details to the end-user, who can use the system oblivious to the presence of other users who might be using the system simultaneously.
## 8.2 MARKET VALUE
After analyzing the market scenario, it was noticed that there is very stiff competition for e-commerce websites and the competition is ever-increasing. However, the demand for e-commerce websites is also very high since the last few years. 
However, there is a dearth of websites dedicated to providing gift items and hence, the market value of Panache shall be expectedly quite high. Also, a bulk of the customers are expected to be youth who shall invest in purchasing gifts for their loved ones.
## 8.3 NOVELTY
The idea of developing an e-commerce website is quite novel as in spite of having a lot of e-commerce websites, ranging from selling apparel to appliances, there is not one website solely dedicated to provide gift items.
Searching for an appropriate gift is particularly hectic as people find it very difficult to acquire viable gift ideas. Thus, Panache proposes to not only provide gift solutions on the basis of relations but also to fit the budget restrictions of the clients. Panache offers gifts starting from prices as low as rupees 100 till as high as 1,15,000 for all relationships.
No website has implemented this idea so far, and is hence, expected to be an instant hit.

## 8.6 DATA FLOW DIAGRAM
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a traditional way to visualize the data flow within a system. It depicts an accurate version of the system requirements graphically. It shows how information enters and leaves the system, what changes the information and where is the processed data stored. The purpose of a DFD is to show the scope and boundaries of a system as a whole. 
A two-level data flow diagram (DFD) has been drawn below to give a process-centric understanding of the problem:

Table 10.1: Activity table with time duration
Network Scheduling is a method of minimizing trouble spots such as bottlenecks, delays and interruptions. An effective project planning and control technique called the Critical Path Method has been used in the current project. The Critical Path Method has been used as an effective software engineering tool to find a Critical Path and time for completion of the project. A list of activities were identified and their durations were estimated approximately and effectively. The standard computation procedures include the following steps:
1)	Calculating the forward pass
2)	Calculating the backward pass
3)	Calculating Earliest and Latest possible times
4)	Calculating Total Float
The following diagram shows the Activity Network Diagram:  
                                       Figure 10.1: Activity Network Diagram
Notations Used: 
 E(i) is the Earliest Start
 E(j) is the Earliest Finish 
L(i) is the Latest Start
L(j) is the Latest Finish
Tij is the normal time needed in days
Tf is the Total Float. (Tf=L(j)-(E(i)+Tij)) 
The table shown in the next page is used to find the critical path:
Activity(i,j)	Time(days) (Tij)	E(i)	E(j)=E(i)+T(ij)	L(i)=L(j)-T(ij)	L(j)	Tf
A (1,2)	6	0	6	0	6	0
B (1,3)	5	0	5	2	7	7
C (1,4)	10	0	10	2	12	4
D (3,4)	2	5	7	8	10	7
E (4,5)	3	8	11	9	12	45
F (5,9)	2	11	13	13	15	45
G (4,6)	15	21	27	20	25	0
H (6,7)	15	27	32	25	30	0
I (7,8)	10	37	47	30	40	0
J (8,9)	10	47	57	40	50	0
K (9,10)	3	57	59	63	65	0
			Table 10.2: Calculation of total float
Critical path: 124678910.
Time needed for completion=6+0+15+15+10+10+2=59 days.
## 10.2 FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
There are several enhancements that can be made to the project to make it sturdier over time. Some of the additional features that can be added are as follows:
1.	Addition of a rating system
2.	Provision of returning and exchanging items
3.	Use of AI for providing smart suggestions
4.	Adding a wish-list for extra convenience.
## 10.3 CONCLUDING REMARKS
This project has been undertaken with utmost care. The work on testing and debugging has been performed with as many inputs as possible. The system gave proper outputs in most of the cases and the remaining unidentified cases were gradually imbibed into the system. 
The e-commerce site “Panache” provides all basic functionalities of a standard e-commerce website and can be used for commercial purposes as well. We would once again extend our heartfelt gratitude to our Professor for providing us this opportunity.
